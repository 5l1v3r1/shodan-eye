Shodan Eye This tool collects all the information about all devices directly connected to the internet using the specified keywords that you enter. This way you get a complete overview.

The types of devices that are indexed can vary enormously: from small desktops, refrigerators to nuclear power plants and everything in between.
You can find everything using "your own" specified keywords(s).

The information gained from this tool can be applied to many areas, a small example:
* Network Security, keep an eye on all devices at your company or home that are facing the Internet.
* Vulnerabilities.
And so much more.

What is the difference between Google or any other search engine:

The most fundamental difference is that Shodan Eye crawls the internet, Google crawls the World Wide Web.
However, the devices that support the World Wide Web are only a small part of what is actually connected to the Internet.
Shodan Eye gives a complete picture of the internet.
